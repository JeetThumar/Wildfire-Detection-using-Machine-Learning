# Wildfire Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to detect wildfires in real-time using satellite data. It leverages a Random Forest Classifier with features such as surface temperature, infrared (IR) bands, vegetation index, humidity, wind speed, and elevation, achieving an accuracy of 93.5% and an ROC-AUC score of 0.96.

## Features
- **Real-time Prediction**: Analyzes satellite data for timely wildfire detection.
- **Key Features**: IR bands, temperature, wind speed, elevation, slope.
- **Performance**: 93.5% accuracy, 94% recall, 0.96 ROC-AUC.
- **EDA**: Includes correlation heatmaps, boxplots, and KDE plots.
